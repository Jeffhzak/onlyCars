# onlyCars

A car rental website, used as practice for developing on a single. fullstack project as a group over the course of a week.

Visit the deployment site: https://ga-only-cars.herokuapp.com/

# Description

We decided on a Car Rental website to practice concepting out business processes - what would be required to create a functional website, and implement a RESTful backend. 

# Tech Stack

>* MongoDB (& Mongoose)
>* Express
>* React
>* NodeJS
>* React Router
>* Axios
>* Date-fns
>* formik

# MVP

* Guests able to view all currently listed Cars, that Users have put up on the site. 
* Guests able to view details page for each car listing out relevant information, that a potential loaner would want to know. 
* Ability to create an account, stored in MongoDB.
* Ability to log in, creating a session that lasts for as long as the user remains on the website. 
* Ability to list a Car as available for rent on the website, creating the representative document in MongoDB.
* Ability for users to be able to rent a Car avaiable on the website, with a proper interface for selecting dates and creating the loan recorded in the database. 

# User Stories

* Guests

The default behaviour of our website. The guests will be able to view the avaiable cars for loan and check out their detailed listing pages.

* Users

The Users will be able to fill in a form to list their Cars for rent on the website. They will also be able to proceed with actually loaning a car and creating a loan event.

* Admin

The admin will have the ability to oversee, edit, and delete everything on the website. With appropriate checks in place to make sure nothing breaks, of course. 


# Approach

As the project is intended to be practice building a fullstack application,  we simply decided to develop individual parts of the website, working on both the front-end AND
back-end as needed. As the week progressed we discussed and came to a consensus on how to integrate our disparate pieces together, and further distributed the work on these
integration tasks.
